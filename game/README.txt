Step 1: Create a function called playGame() that will execute every time you click the 'deal cards' button

Step 2: Set variables for player 1
a) generate a random number between 1 and 5. Set it as a variable.
b) set the first image as a variable called 'player1'
c) change the attribute of player1's src so that each time you click 'deal cards', a random card is selected

HINT: the cards are written as card1, card2, card3 etc, with 1 being the weakest card and 5 being the strongest.
HINT2: you will have to use string concatenation for the URL of the image file changes accordingly.

Step 3: Set variables for player 2, as above

Step 3: Set your win conditions
a) set the results heading as a variable
b) create a conditional statement that checks who's won. If player 1's card is bigger than player 2's, change the text of the heading to say 'Player 1 Wins!' etc.
